# Personal Website

Repo for a personal website. Built using TypeScript, [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) and [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/).

Developed with node 20.10.0 and npm 10.2.3

Ideas:

* Noisy / CRT monitor texture background
* Animated background: ascii letters or code snippets randomly appearing and disappearing (ghosting effect)
* Back to top floating button
* Light / Dark mode
* Typewriter effect variant for all/most text
  * Unlike the current TypeWriterEffect, content must exist in html even before the typewriter effect starts to not break screen readers / indexing
* Project details page/modal
